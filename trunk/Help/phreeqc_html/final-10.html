Activities and Mass-Action Equations</STRONG></H1>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-250167"></A>In this section the activities of aqueous, exchange, and surface species are defined and the mass-action relations for each species are presented. Equations are derived from the mass-action expression for the moles of each species in the chemical system in terms of the master unknowns. These equations are then differentiated with respect to the master unknowns. Later, these equations for the moles of a species and the partial derivatives will be substituted into the constituent mole-balance, charge-balance, and phase-equilibria functions.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-306654"></A>PHREEQC allows speciation or equilibration with respect to a single aqueous phase. However, multiple aqueous phases may be defined in the course of a run and an aqueous phase may be defined as a mixture of one or more aqueous phases (see <STRONG CLASS="Bold">
<A HREF="final-47.html#16565" CLASS="XRef">MIX</A></STRONG> keyword in &quot;Description of Data Input&quot;). The dissolved species in the aqueous phase are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, with one exception; in initial solution calculations, disequilibrium among valence states of redox elements is allowed.

<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-306652"></A>PHREEQC rewrites all chemical equations in terms of master species. There is one master aqueous species associated with each element (for example, Ca<SUP CLASS="Superscript">
+2</SUP>
 for calcium) or element valence state (for example, Fe<SUP CLASS="Superscript">
+3</SUP>
 for ferric iron) plus the activity of the hydrogen ion, the activity of the aqueous electron, and the activity of water. Some programs, for example MINTEQA2 (Allison and others, 1990) and MINEQL<SUP CLASS="Superscript">
+</SUP>
 (Schecher and McAvoy, 1991) use the term &quot;component&quot; for these species, but that terminology is not used here because of confusion with the definition of component for the Gibbs' phase rule. For PHREEQC, the identity of each aqueous master species is defined with <STRONG CLASS="Bold">
<A HREF="final-57.html#19910" CLASS="XRef">SOLUTION_MASTER_SPECIES</A></STRONG> data block (see &quot;Description of Data Input&quot;). The numerical method reduces the number of unknowns to be a minimum number of master unknowns, and iteratively refines the values of these master unknowns until a solution to the set of algebraic equations is found. The master unknowns for aqueous solutions are the natural log of the activities of master species, the natural log of the activity of water, <IMG SRC="final-4.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">

Exchange Species</STRONG></H2>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-250264"></A>Ion-exchange equilibria are included in the model through heterogeneous mass-action equations and mole-balance equations for exchange sites. PHREEQC allows multiple exchangers, termed an &quot;exchange assemblage&quot;, to exist in equilibrium with the aqueous phase. The approach uses mass-action expressions based on half-reactions between aqueous species and a fictive unoccupied exchange site (Appelo and Postma, 1993) for each exchanger. This unoccupied exchange site is the master species for the exchanger and the log of its activity is an additional master unknown. Its identity is defined with <STRONG CLASS="Bold">
<A HREF="final-40.html#33835" CLASS="XRef">EXCHANGE_MASTER_SPECIES</A></STRONG> data block (see &quot;Description of Data Input&quot;). However, the master species is not included in the mole-balance equation for the exchanger, forcing its physical concentration to be zero. Its activity is also physically meaningless, but is such that all of the exchange sites are filled by other exchange species. </P>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-250271"></A>The unknowns for exchange calculations are the activity, <IMG SRC="final-23.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">

 is the total number of equivalents of the exchanger in the system, which is not necessarily equal to the number of equivalents per kilogram of water (eq/kgw) because the mass of water in the system may be more or less than 1 kg. By default, the activity coefficient for an exchange species is 1.0, but optionally, a Davies, extended Debye-H&uuml;ckel, or WATEQ Debye-H&uuml;ckel activity coefficient can be used, which is based on the aqueous ionic strength and the number of equivalents of exchange sites occupied by the exchange species.</P>

Surface Species</STRONG></H2>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-250349"></A>Surface-complexation processes are included in the model through heterogeneous mass-action equations, mole-balance equations for surface sites, and charge-potential relations for each surface. PHREEQC allows multiple surfaces and surface-site types, termed a &quot;surface assemblage&quot;, to exist in equilibrium with the aqueous phase. Two formulations of the mass-action equations for surface species are available in PHREEQC: (1) one that includes electrostatic potential terms and (2) another that excludes all electrostatic potential terms. If the Dzombak and Morel (1990) model, which includes electrostatic potential terms, is used, additional equations and mass-action terms become operational because of surface charge and surface electrostatic potential.</P>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-306876"></A>The two principle differences between the formulation of exchange reactions and surface reactions are that exchange reactions are formulated as half-reactions, which causes the master species not to appear in any mole-balance equations, and the exchange species are expected to be neutral. Surface reactions are not half-reactions, so the master species is a physically real species and appears in mole-balance equations, and surface species may be anionic, cationic, or neutral. </P>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-306892"></A>The basic theory for surface-complexation reactions including electrostatic potentials is presented in Dzombak and Morel (1990). The theory assumes that the number of active sites, <EM CLASS="Emphasis">

<SUB><EM>

F</EM>
 is the Faraday constant (96493.5 J V<SUP CLASS="Superscript">

R </EM>
is the gas constant (8.3147 J mol<SUP CLASS="Superscript">
-1</SUP>
 K<SUP CLASS="Superscript">

), and <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
T</EM>
 is temperature (Kelvin) and (2) the natural log of the activity of the master surface species. Note that the quantity <IMG SRC="final-45.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
 is defined with a 2 in the denominator of the term on the right-hand side. This is a different master unknown than that used in Dzombak and Morel (1990), but produces the same results as their model because all equations are written to be consistent with this master unknown.</P>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-250363"></A>The activity of a surface species is assumed to be equal to the mole fraction of a given surface-site type that is occupied. In other words, a surface species is in the standard state (has activity of 1) when it completely covers a given kind of surface site. This convention differs from Dzombak and Morel (1990) who assumed that activity of a surface species (conceptually in the solid phase) is numerically equal to molarity (concentration in solution). If only monodentate complexes are considered (as is done by Dzombak and Morel, 1990), terms cancel in the mass-action equation and identical numerical results are obtained irrespective of the convention for standard state. However, a notable difference in surface site concentration exists when the molarity convention is used for multidentate complexes (bidentate, tridentate, and others, cf. Appelo and Postma, 1999). If a vessel contains a solution in equilibrium with a surface containing multidentate species, and more of exactly the same solution is added, the composition of solution and surface would change with the molarity convention. The molarity convention is clearly not correct in this case.</P>

<A NAME="pgfId-307544"></A>Equilibrium between a multicomponent gas phase and the aqueous phase is modeled with heterogeneous mass-action equations and an equation for total pressure (fixed-pressure gas phase only). Only one gas phase can exist in equilibrium with the aqueous phase, but the gas phase may contain multiple components. All gas components are assumed to behave ideally and the gas phase is assumed to be an ideal mixture of gas components.</P>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-307730"></A>If a gas phase is specified to have a fixed volume, then the pressure in the gas volume will vary with reaction extent, but each gas component will always be present in the gas phase. For a fixed-volume gas phase, no additional master unknowns are needed, and the moles of a component in the gas phase can be calculated from the activities of the aqueous master species. </P>
<P CLASS="BodyText">
<A NAME="pgfId-307731"></A>If a gas phase is specified to have a fixed pressure, the gas phase is a fixed-pressure bubble that will vary in volume with reaction extent. If the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases is less than the specified total pressure, the fixed-pressure gas phase will not exist and none of the gas components will be present in the gas phase. For a fixed-pressure gas phase, one additional master unknown is included in the equations, which is the total moles of gas components in the gas phase, <EM CLASS="Emphasis">

<A NAME="pgfId-307472"></A>By the assumption of ideality, the fugacity (activity) of a gas component is equal to its partial pressure. PHREEQC uses dissolution equations, in the sense that the gas component is assumed to be on the left-hand side of the chemical reaction.
